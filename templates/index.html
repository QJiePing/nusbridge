        <p>We use your aspirations, your current education, your cumulative experience and a personality test to evaluate who are similar to you and who are complementary to you. Both could be valuable for your aspirations. Based on your personality results, we would suggest to you how you can understand others by understanding yourself.</p>

            <p>Your connections are the most important assets for your personal well-being and professional success. It can be challenging to understand the value of your connections in an academic setting. What is not obvious could be valuable; it might be overlooked. Our mission is to make it as clear as possible by putting the minds of everyone in NUS so that we can bring collective wisdom to you for your aspiration. You might also make new connections. All we need for our mission and the clarity for your aspiration is your contribution.</p>
